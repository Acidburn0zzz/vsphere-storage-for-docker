# Introduction to Docker Volume Driver for vSphere

Docker volume driver is designed to solve persistency needs for 
stateful containers running on top of VMware's stack.

Some of the high level features for the plugin are: 

1. Designed to run over shared storage in a cluster (Single node 
test setups supported as well)
2. Easy to deploy and manage. There is zero configuration and 
zero credential management.
3. Integrated with vCenter and Photon Controller
