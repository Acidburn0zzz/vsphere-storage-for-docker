# Introduction to Docker Volume Driver for vSphere

vSphere Docker Volume service enables you to run stateful containerized applications on top of VMwareâ€™s stack i.e. on vSphere. 

It is designed to:

- **Provide proven persistent shared storage:** You can now use any VMware supported enterprise class storage backed by vSAN, VMFS, NFS, etc. 
- **Enable Multitenancy, Security and Access Control:** vSphere Admins can effortlessly set access permissions for shared storage across hosts, datastores and VMs from a single location
- **Provide Operational Simplicity:** Zero Configuration, zero credential management. It as easy to deploy and manage

Enable self-serve operational model: Use docker APIs to manage volume lifecycle while maintaining admin control over consumption 

This plugin is integrated with [Docker Volume Plugin framework](https://docs.docker.com/engine/extend/plugins_volume/). This plugin does not need credential management or configuration management.
