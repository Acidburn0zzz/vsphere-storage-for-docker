# Docker VMDK volume plugin - includes Go vmdkops module and ESX python service

WIP: This is work in progress and I do not expect it to be useful yet

text TBD.

Build prereqs: 
 - Linux with Docker 1.9
 - 32 bit headers 'apt-get libc6-dev-i386' 
     (clean up in progress, will be part of dockerfiles)
 - build on clean boxes needs to be validated, there are probably issues
